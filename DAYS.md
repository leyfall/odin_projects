       (which was written by the founder of The Odin Project. This article gives a realistic view of what the journey ahead is like)
       
 Web design reading it on wiki. 
 
        (describes the breadth of the web development profession.)
Reading the "Udacity’s blog post on front-end, back-end and full stack developers"

Asking a question in TOP discord:

       So, to summarize, don't ask "Any Java experts around?", but rather ask "How do I do [problem] with Java and [other relevant info]?"

Adding the "projects" branches so i can see it in different branch and not in the main one.

Day 5 (12.22.25):

1st Class Language you need to know:
        
         - Ruby, Javascript (unfortunately still don't know about this languages)
         - Json and jq

Leetcode initiate first solve but copy and look on the problem for 

960:  Delete Columns to Make Sorted II

       this problem looks very similar to the Delete Columns to Make Sorted II we solved yesterday. But in the earlier version, our goal was to make the array of strings lexicographically sorted with respect to each other. Here however, the requirement subtly changes: after deleting some columns, each individual string (row) must be lexicographically sorted on its own. Instead of comparing rows with one another, we now focus on preserving order within the same row, while still deleting columns globally. - Srinivasa Pradeep

I haven't full grasp whats all of this about but as you can see I wanna try and understand it although C++ and other language im not quite good at this.
