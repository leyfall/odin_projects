**Coding Projects**

_Coding journey and history._

Putting all of the stuffs I'll learn for everyday.

studying everyday till I ~~learn all the foundamental~~ somebody ask me "Hey can I use that?" or "Let me pay/play that"

Day 1 (12.18.25): 

Flow -- but learning back the basics of odin.

Day 2 (12.19.25):

Learning that the phase of learning to code (again) will be very much painful, knowing you can do it for the best.

       (which was written by the founder of The Odin Project. This article gives a realistic view of what the journey ahead is like)
       
 Web design reading it on wiki. 
 
        (describes the breadth of the web development profession.)
Reading the "Udacity’s blog post on front-end, back-end and full stack developers"

Day 3 (12.20.25): (Late study and doing things)

Stuffs to learn how to manage time and productivity in focus + the what to do  in breaks.

Avoid AI for asking a question -- used the Odin Community + Google

Day 4 (12.21.25):

Putting a new project to learn such as the new single page cv something.

Asking a question in TOP discord:

       So, to summarize, don't ask "Any Java experts around?", but rather ask "How do I do [problem] with Java and [other relevant info]?"

Adding the "projects" branches so i can see it in different branch and not in the main one.

Day 5 (12.22.25):

Taking notes and learning in my Kindle V about Fundamentals stuffs in Github.

1st Class Language you need to know:
        
         - Ruby, Javascript (unfortunately still don't know about this languages)
         - Json and jq

Leetcode initiate first solve but copy and look on the problem for 

960:  Delete Columns to Make Sorted II

       this problem looks very similar to the Delete Columns to Make Sorted II we solved yesterday. But in the earlier version, our goal was to make the array of strings lexicographically sorted with respect to each other. Here however, the requirement subtly changes: after deleting some columns, each individual string (row) must be lexicographically sorted on its own. Instead of comparing rows with one another, we now focus on preserving order within the same row, while still deleting columns globally. - Srinivasa Pradeep

I haven't full grasp whats all of this about but as you can see I wanna try and understand it although C++ and other language im not quite good at this.

Im starting to day 1 in leetcode tomorrow, but all good today no need to rush.

Day 6 (12.23.25):

Not so productive shit or anything
Gone through immersing myself on what to do to my Pocketbook 
       Koreader failure, win, failure
              Been Doing what i have to do to finish this.

Day 7 (12.24.25):

Learning CTCI for leetcode problem--- will continue after i goo and yeah its christmas eve HAPPY CHRISTMAS DAY!!! see you tomorrow folks.

Reading the html for begineer the easy way and stuffs.

-Reading HTML to refresh my mind for 5 minutes.

Day 11 (12.28.25): Late night study---lazy.

- Setting up Git and Github (github is already done, just updating git) 5mins
- Step 3: Let us know how it went!
         -It went good although i did not know or why i did not put the ssh key before but anyway all success now. (Small steps is much better compared to none.)

Day 12 (12.29.25): Early a bit but could lapse 50mins for this (hopefully)

- (done) Read chapters 1.1 through 1.4 from the Getting Started section of Pro Git to learn the differences between local, centralized, and distributed version control systems.
- (done) Watch “What is Git?” explained in 2 minutes - a video about what Git is and how it can improve the workflow of both an individual and a team of developers.
- (done) Read “About GitHub and Git” for a brief introduction of what GitHub is and how Git and GitHub work together. You can skip the “Where do I start?” section at the end.
- (done) If you haven’t yet installed Git, visit the Setting Up Git lesson.
- (done) Take a look at The Odin Project’s GitHub repository. This is where all the lessons are stored! While you’re there, look at all our contributors to gain an appreciation for how Git records all collaborative efforts and how GitHub visually represents this.
- Putting git to test.
- done hopefully the test after i commit this.

Day 13 (12.30.25): OH GODS i never thought i did so much yesterday and now im dead lol.

- Just reading the HTTP origin for now.
- I just realized that it was git push!!! for the git commit i think. Lets test it.

Day 16 (01.02.26): 

- Reading CCI for 10mins
- I'm dying idk what to do with the Leetcode stuff but i have to, I keep reading the two sum or something and then boom. I'm confuse
- Decided to take course of C++ and Python since I want to acknowledge ~~how dumb I am.~~ how trash of not learning it.
- Fixing the mindset of being dumb. My learning is dumb not me.
